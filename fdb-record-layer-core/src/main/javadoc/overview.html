A record-oriented layer built for the FoundationDB key-value store.

<p>
This layer is designed to extend the FoundationDB key-value store by adding a record-oriented data model. Though
this layer does not attempt to implement SQL, it does provide relational semantics (broadly defined). In particular,
it attempts to provide solutions to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Schema management</li>
    <li>Index maintenance</li>
    <li>Query planning and optimization</li>
</ul>

<p>
The basic unit of data is the "record". This corresponds to a "row" in a traditional relational system or
to a "document" in a document database. Records are grouped together into "record stores", which are
somewhat analogous to a "database" in a traditional relational database, and each record also has a "type"
which is somewhat (but not quite) analogous to a "table". (See, however,
<a href="https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-record-layer/FAQ.html#are-record-types-tables">"Are record types tables?"</a>
in the <a href="https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-record-layer/FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for an explanation of
the differences between the two concepts.)
